# Personal Website
I decided to reconstruct my website, due to the fact that it has a very poor UX and UI which makes me wonder, how did I even managed to pull up all night doing my website. Trying to get used with Linux, as it is going to be my friend... For now.

### What am I currently working on?
I am mainly working on the frontpage of my website. My current homepage, doesn't seem to be very fascinating, and also my website seems to be unfinished since there are a lot of anchor tags leading to dead links, which I will reassure to clean up.

Please cPanel... Just add support for Javascript framework *cough cough*

### Libraries being used?
* NPM
* Bootstrap 3

### Constructive Feedback?
Feel free to leave constructive feedback towards my source code, and I will look upon improving it.
